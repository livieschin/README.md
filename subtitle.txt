Let’s start at the beginning with an overview
of cloud computing. Cloud computing is a way of using information
technology, IT, that has these five equally important traits. First, customers get computing resources that
are on-demand and self-service. Through a web interface, users get the processing
power, storage, and network they need with no need for human intervention. Second, customers get access to those resources
over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection. Third, the cloud provider has a big pool of
those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool. That allows the provider to buy in bulk
and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about
the exact physical location of those resources. Fourth, the resources are elastic–which
means they’re flexible, so customers can be. If they need more resources they can get more,
and quickly. If they need less, they can scale back. And finally, customers pay only for what they
use, or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying. That's it. That's the definition of cloud. Google Cloud offers a variety of services
for architects and developers to use to build solutions. Some might sound familiar, like virtual machines,
whereas others might represent a totally new paradigm, like Google Kubernetes Engine. A common first request that organizations
make of Google Cloud is to run some code in the cloud. Google offers a range of computing services
to help fulfill that request. We’ll explore these options next.
